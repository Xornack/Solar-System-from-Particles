# Solar-System-from-Particles
This is a simulation of the formation of the Solar System by Peter Collenridge. I made it work in python 3.6, but the main change is just
that the star doesn't fly off the screen but shoots around to the other side.

For the future, I would like to create another version in 3D using Panda3D and instead of the color changing, the brightness would
change (more massive particles would be brighter and larger).
